# MotioninJoy Offline
Use your PS3 Controller on your PC using MotioninJoy.  

Disclaimer:   
This is not the official Motioninjoy Version!  
This version acts as an replacement for the official version which seems to not be maintained anymore and requires a connection to a now offline website (which makes it unusable). 
I am not the creator of this software or the drivers! This repository is just a place to host them.
